## Riding a Boosted Board in Trondheim 🏄‍♂️

I've been cruising around Trondheim on my Boosted Board for years. It's quick, convenient, and a whole lot of fun.

## Limitations of the Boosted Board ❌

But let's be real—riding in bad weather is a no-go, among other disadvantages.

## The Transition to eBike 🚴‍♀️

That's why I decided it was time for a change. I wanted something that could handle Trondheim's varying conditions. Enter the eBike.
I found a beautiful Retrovelo Anna fitted with a [Pendix eDrive kit](https://pendix.com/) on [Finn.no](https://finn.no).

Even better, the seller connected me with someone keen to buy my Boosted Board. It was a win-win, although parting with my Boosted Board was bittersweet.

## Customizing My eBike 🛠

The real fun began after the purchase – I got a front rack box and I designed and 3D-printed a [battery holder protection cap](https://www.printables.com/model/51439-pendix-edrive-dustcover) and a [holder for a plastic bag](https://www.printables.com/model/226822-bike-seat-plastic-bag-holder) which I can put on the seat when I leave the bike out in the rain.

## Battery Woes 😞

Unfortunately, my joy was short-lived. The battery started failing just a couple of months in. A real bummer, considering I just bought it, but it was from 2018, so not really that shocking.

## Considering Alternatives 💰

A new Pendix battery was ridiculously expensive, so I started to look at alternatives. Another buddy of mine recently converted his own bike with the Bafang BBS02 kit. This was approx. equally costly but should have more power.

## The Conversion Hiccup 🛠️

The conversion was a challenge. My bike had an eccentric bottom bracket, making it incompatible with the Bafang motor. I had to make some, let's say, irreversible modifications, but the motor finally fit!

## Aesthetic Touches to the Phone Mount 🎨

I also bought a Quad Lock copy for my phone, but its red color needed a spray-paint makeover.

## The Bafang Setback 😖

Despite my best efforts, the Bafang motor proved too powerful for my bike's hub gear. The bike became jumpy and made weird noises—making for an unpleasant riding experience.

## Back to Pendix 🔄

In the end, I reconnected with the local Pendix retailer. Luckily, he had a smaller Pendix battery that I could get for a reasonable 3000 kroners. 

![Pendix 150 vs 300](https://github.com/petrepa/petrepa.github.io/assets/30476405/3c93f464-a57a-40d4-bdf8-ecd5df41f57c)

So, I converted my bike back to Pendix, and here we are.




## Conclusion 📝

Switching from a Boosted Board to a custom eBike has been a rollercoaster of a journey, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It's been an educational and fun experience. And has also led to another build ...
