# Introduction: Random Projects, Big Satisfaction üõ†Ô∏è

Not every project needs to be a grand affair. Sometimes, it's the small and practical solutions that you quickly build day-to-day that can give the most joy. Here's a glimpse into some of my mini-projects in 2023.

## Custom 3D Printed Storage Case üì¶

With some leftover wood and a need for organization, I crafted a storage case to fit under my 3D printer cabinet. It's a simple drawer, but I also added some 3D printed components and metal rails to finish it off and cover the chipboard. Functional and just right for storing filaments and related 3D printer tools.

## Belt Bag for Nails üî®

During the summer of 2023, while helping my dad build his 'naust', I needed a way to store all of the nails. I turned to sewing for the first time, repurposing an old pair of pants into a useful belt bag for nails. It's not pretty, but for a first sewing project, it was fun and  did the job perfectly.

## Evolution of My Smart Mirror ü™û

Creating a smart mirror was one of my first projects after moving to Trondheim to study. Initially documented here: [petrepa/MagicMirror](https://github.com/petrepa/MagicMirror), I've since upgraded the Nissedal frame to a wood finish frame. More importantly, I transitioned away from the [MagicMirror](https://magicmirror.builders/) firmware to a custom interface in Home Assistant. This switch better suits my needs, as Home Assistant has all the information I require and an AMOLED theme ensures that the mirror effect still works nicely.

Below you can see a quick screenshot of the lovelace dashboard showing on the mirror.

## Ryobi Work Lamp üí°

Needing more light for outdoor projects, I made a Ryobi 18v work lamp with a 3D printed adapter. Now, I have a portable light source compatible with my existing batteries, making late-night work outside a bit easier.

## Flexible Soldering Fan üå¨Ô∏è

After experimenting with various soldering fan setups, I landed on a design using a small PC fan attached to a flexible GoPro arm. It's mounted with a quick clamp for easy desk attachment. The fan, now with integrated lights, automatically activates when I start soldering, thanks to my ESPHome desk hub (similar to [this project](https://github.com/petrepa/ESPHome-Solder_Station) but with other parts) setup and Home Assistant's data reading from my Bluetooth-enabled soldering iron ([Pinecil V2](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/)).

## Mobile Holder for Desk üì±

Inspired by a TikTok after probably too long time scrolling, I repurposed an IKEA Tertial lamp arm into a flexible mobile holder. It features a LED strip for some symbolic lighting and a neatly routed USB cable connected to my desk computer. The most important feature is the quick clamp, which makes it super easy to move and position at different places. This setup improves my Zoom game significantly since my phone can now serve as a webcam thanks to a [recent Pixel update](https://support.google.com/googlecamera/answer/14274129?hl=en).
