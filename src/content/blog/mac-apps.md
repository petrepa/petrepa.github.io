Sometimes, it's the little things that make daily life a bit easier. Over time, I've put together a few modest tools for my Mac, mostly to solve small, personal annoyances. Here's a brief overview of these simple projects.

## [OV macOS Statusbar](https://github.com/petrepa/OV-Mac-OS-Statusbar): A Quick Campus Check
First up was the OV macOS Statusbar. It's a basic status bar app that shows the door status of Omega Verksted, which was quite handy during exams for knowing when to take a snack break. It's pretty straightforward and was only tested on macOS Mojave, but was a bit combersome to set up.



## [BitBar-OV-Door](https://github.com/petrepa/BitBar-OV-door): An Easier Alternative
After discovering Bitbar, I made remade the OV tool, BitBar-OV-Door. It does the same thing but in a more straightforward way. The neat part is it only shows the status when connected to 'eduroam', the network on campus, keeping the status bar tidy and uncluttered when you're not at school.

## [BitBar-HASS-Fetch](https://github.com/petrepa/BitBar-HASS-fetch): Home Info at a Glance
Then there's BitBar-HASS-Fetch, a simple plugin using the Home Assistant API. It puts sensor values from your home into the Mac status bar. Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done.

## [Bitbar-macOS-BatteryIndicator](https://github.com/petrepa/Bitbar-macOS-batteryindicator): Just a Battery Status
Lastly, I made a small tweak to an existing Bitbar plugin by [Eric Ripas](https://getbitbar.com/plugins/System/Battery/battery-status.20s.py) to create the Bitbar-macOS-BatteryIndicator. It simply shows the battery status when not charging.

# Wrapping Up
These were just small, low-effort tools I built out of personal necessity. They're not groundbreaking, but they made my everyday Mac use a bit more convenient.
