# Introduction: Ideas and Skills 🛠️💡
Living with a creative soul like my girlfriend means our home is always buzzing with new project ideas, for better or for worse. From functional redesigns to aesthetic innovations, here's a peek into our world of DIY.

# Laundry Basket Makeover: Function Meets Aesthetics 🧺
We modified our laundry baskets to fit inbetween the wall and the sink by shortening its width a bit. We then crafted a bespoke bamboo table, from two second hand [IKEA RÅGRUND](https://www.ikea.com/no/no/p/ragrund-stol-m-handklehenger-bambus-90253074/), to elegantly conceal them, combining practicality with style.

# Brainstorming in Style: Glass Greenboard Shelves 🌿📝
Our office got a functional upgrade with three glass greenboards for brainstorming sessions. We built a custom shelf to house these boards, creating an efficient yet stylish brainstorming hub.

# IKEA Cabinet Reimagined: Joining the IKEAGreenHouseClub 🌱
An ordinary IKEA display cabinet transformed into a thriving plant cabinet, earning us a spot in the IKEAGreenHouseClub. This project was a mix of redesign and green-thumb enthusiasm.
For this project we've added fans to circulate the air, grow lights controlled and warm/cold lights controlled by a Shelly RGBW2 and we've also added humidity control through the [ESPHome Diffuser](https://github.com/petrepa/ESPHome-Diffuser).

# Entrance Wardrobe Revamp: Stealth and Functionality 🚪
We reimagined our IKEA Elvarli wardrobe to make it fit in more with our overall aestetic.

# Kitchen Drawer Inserts: Customized to Perfection 🍴
In our kitchen, we created custom drawer ([using this 3D model project](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3827538)) inserts to fit our unique assortment of kitchen tools, ensuring everything has its perfect place.

# The Viral TikTok Sofa Lamp 💡
Inspired by a [viral TikTok lamp](https://www.tiktok.com/@freakyfundays/video/7164439405531352326), we crafted our own version. Starting with an IKEA laundry rack and a vintage lamp, we added a couple of layers with spray-painted brown finish and brass mounting details.
