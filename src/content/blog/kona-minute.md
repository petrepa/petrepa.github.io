## Finding the Perfect Bike 🕵️‍♂️

After I had a spare Bafang motor, from my [Retrovelo bike](https://petrepa.com/blog/ebikes/), I scoured [Finn.no](https://finn.no) for the ideal bike. My main criterias: disc brakes and affordability. Eventually, on page 9 of Trondheim's listings, I discovered a Kona Minute.

## Love at First Sight ❤️

Priced at just 1500 NOK, the Kona Minute, a long-tail cargo bike, was a steal. When I saw it in person, its potential was undeniable, despite its janky basket, weak brakes, and unsightly handlebar grips.

## The Transformation Begins 🛠️

I dove into converting it the next day, adding a stealthy black touch to certain parts, ditching the basket, and swapping out the grips.

My first mission on it was to [Trondheim Sykkelservice](https://trondheimsykkelservice.no/) for new handlebar grips.

## Road Testing 🚴‍♂️

The cargo capacity of the Kona Minute, especially for items like laser-cut storage boxes designed by my girlfriend, was quite the upgrade.

## Lighting and Practical Mods 🔦

I hacked a basic rear light I had laying around to sync with the Bafang's front light and, since the kit I bought didn't include a rear light

Of course, I also added my [plastic bag storage](https://www.printables.com/model/226822-bike-seat-plastic-bag-holder).

Eventually, I attached an IKEA Kaosig collapsible box, perfect for everyday items but also collapsible so I could put it flat and carry larger cargo on top.

## Addressing Hand Pain and Handlebar Missteps 🤕

After some weeks, hand pain led me to mistakenly replace the ergonomic handlebars with flatter ones. The real issue? The steering wheel was too low, leading to excessive pressure on my hands. Too bad I already sold the original handlbars...

## DIY Repairs and Upgrades 🧰

I designed a replacement for a lost [plastic piece of the center support](https://www.printables.com/model/578472-bike-centre-supportbike-stand-piece) and switched to hydraulic brakes, thanks to Marcus's help and tools. This was the most significant upgrade besides the eBike conversion itself.

## Adventures in Cargo Transport 📦

The Kona Minute proved its worth by easily transporting big items, like my new pizza oven.

I also enhanced its versatility with an [Atran Velo AVS](https://atranvelo.com/avs/) front carrier and basket.

## Winter Cycling Preparations ❄️🚴‍♂️

With winter approaching, I equipped the bike with [Biltema studded tires](https://www.biltema.no/sykkel-elsykkel/sykkeldeler/sykkeldekk/26/sykkeldekk-pigg-26-54-559-mm-2000037421). Later, after experiencing their limitations, I upgraded to Ice Spiker Pro tires for better grip and safety. I have also fitted some bar mitts to the bike, even though these look super nørdy. Gotta stay warm!

## Continuous Comfort Adjustments 🛠️

Continued hand pain led to further research, resulting in a more upright seating position with a new stem and handlebars. Shouldn't have sold the original handlbars..........

## Enhanced Lighting for Dark Rides 💡

I designed a helmet [mount for my Sofirn HS10 headlamp](https://www.printables.com/model/637479-sofirn-hs10-helmet-mount), significantly improving visibility during nighttime rides. The original Bafang front light sucks.

## Conclusion: A Work in Progress 🔄

The Kona Minute will probably be a never-ending story of tweaks, upgrades, and personalization, as I think I will have this bike for many many years. But every change makes it more uniquely mine.
