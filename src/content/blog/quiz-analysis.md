This spring (2024), my friends and I took part in a quiz competition at Quizkverna. As a on and off web developer, I saw an opportunity to combine coding with my enthusiasm for the quizze. I gathered some data throughout the season in a notion table and created a simple static HTML page to analyze the data we gathered. This project helped me practice my web development and data visualisation skills.

### Inspiration üí°

I think the idea came from seeing a funny webpage called [PoopLog](https://nick-barth.com/pooplog/). The creator used amusing data abouyt his poop to practice his data visualization skills. While his data was much more funny than mine, the concept inspired me to use our quiz data similarly. The resul can be fount here: [KVENNJEGUTANE v√•rsesongen 2024](petrepa.com/kvennjegutane)

### Building the Webpage üõ†Ô∏è

I used basic HTML and CSS for structure and style, and JavaScript for data visualization. This helped us see our strengths and areas for improvement.

### The Data Analysis üìà

Besides the web development, the goal was to review our quiz performance data to identify areas for improvement before the next season of Quizkverna. Analyzing metrics like correct answers and other stuff might hopefully help us in the next season. Probably not really.

### Looking Ahead üîç

This project improved my web development skills and provided insights into our quiz performance. It combined my love for meeting my mates for some quiz with my interest in technology.

### Conclusion üèÅ

Creating a webpage to analyze our quiz data was a fun little project. Inspired by [PoopLog](https://nick-barth.com/pooplog/), I turned a simple idea into a ironic useful/unuseful tool for our team. We're now ready to improve for the fall season of Quizkverna!!!!
