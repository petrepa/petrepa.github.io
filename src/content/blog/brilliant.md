## The Genesis of the Idea 🏓

Working at Brilliant, an IT consultancy company, meant finding creative ways to sharpen our skills. It all started with an idle table tennis table and a spark of inspiration from my master's study area [PongDog](https://github.com/jakvah/PongDog). I decided to build my own table tennis tracking system.

## Crafting the Solution with Django and Raspberry Pi 🛠️

The core of my project was Django - robust and flexible. The setup? A Raspberry Pi connected to a TV, transforming each game into a spectacle.

## Scanning In and Scoring Points: The Fun Begins 📊

The real game-changer was integrating company card scans to start a match. Adding buttons for point tracking on the table's side brought a simple way to track points. Built this using a ESP8266 and ESPHome to program. This communicated to the Django server using the REST API.

## The Evolution of the Setup 🏆
The system quickly developed. The Brilliant office was also renovated, and the table tennis table moved. This resulted in the table tennis setup getting its own TV. Of course the UI needed to get a dark mode, matching the newly renovated space.

This wasn't just a tracker; it was a season-based competition. Each season had its scorecards, highlighting the best players and settling office debates.

Here is also another part of the GUI, for example the end of match screen:

## Transforming Office Culture: Engagement and Fun 🤾‍♂️

What started as a tracking system evolved into a catalyst for engagement. It led to regular training sessions and a palpable buzz around the office.

This project at Brilliant was more than a technical challenge; it was a journey of community building, innovation, and fun. It set the tone for my time at this company.
