## Introduction: A Love for Zip Ties üöÄ

For me, zip ties are indispensable tools, right up there with gaffa tape, WD40, and my Leatherman. The motivation behind building my own zip tie holders was simple: I wanted to quickly grab a zip tie without rummaging through a jumbled mess.

## The First Attempt: Version 0.5 üñ®Ô∏è

My journey began in 2020 with Version 0.5. This initial design featured spiral printed holders in vase mode for black and white zip ties, specifically tailored for our MDF tool wall. 
![Spiral holders](https://github.com/petrepa/petrepa.github.io/assets/30476405/a2404e15-5286-4db1-b89e-cf0bf0dc5ad0)

The base, however, was a bit wobbly and weak - a starting point ripe for improvement.

## From Weak to Beefy: Version 1.0 Upgrade üî©

I retained the original vase mode printed holders due to their functionality but revamped the base to be more robust. Version 1.0, with its beefed-up base, was a significant step up (but a bad design by my standards today), providing stability and ease of access for a couple of years.

## A New Home: The Prototype for 2.0 üè†

When I moved, the absence of an MDF tool wall led me to having to design for a pegboard setup. Eager to explore laser cutting but pressed for patience, I quickly designed a 3D printed prototype for something that in the future could become a laser cut design. This "temporary" solution, incorporating the original vase mode holders with a new base, was surprisingly effective.

## The Leap to Laser Cutting: Designing Version 3.0 (or 2.0?) üåü

As the PLA printed parts of the prototype start to sag, I'm now revisiting my initial idea of a laser-cut design. This project has been a great opportunity to sharpen my skills in Fusion360, especially in designing components and understanding constraints.

I finally took the time to cut the things at [Omega Verksted](https://omegav.no). I also got to test [Deepnest](https://deepnest.io/) to optimize the cut pattern. ![Cutter in action](https://github.com/petrepa/petrepa.github.io/assets/30476405/7d58d6a7-2c43-45e6-b9dd-d59555cd362a)

Here the new version is compared to the protoype.

And finally up on the wall! ![New version mounted](https://github.com/petrepa/petrepa.github.io/assets/30476405/e34e09d5-e2e6-4c6f-9b5a-0ce412ce7238)

(and yes, I assembled it wrong so the middle parts on the upper side and not on the lower side as in the original design, buuuut luckily it works great hehe)
