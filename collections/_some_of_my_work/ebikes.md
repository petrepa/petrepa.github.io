## 🏄‍♂️ Riding a Boosted Board in Trondheim

I've been cruising around Trondheim on my Boosted Board for years. It's quick, convenient, and a whole lot of fun.

## ❌ Limitations of the Boosted Board

But let's be real—riding in bad weather is a no-go, among other disadvantages.

## 🚴‍♀️ The Transition to eBike

That's why I decided it was time for a change. I wanted something that could handle Trondheim's varying conditions. Enter the eBike.
I found a beautiful Retrovelo Anna fitted with a [Pendix eDrive kit](https://pendix.com/) on [Finn.no](https://finn.no).

Even better, the seller connected me with someone keen to buy my Boosted Board. It was a win-win, although parting with my Boosted Board was bittersweet.

## 🛠 Customizing My eBike

The real fun began after the purchase – I got a front rack box and I designed and 3D-printed a [battery holder protection cap](https://www.printables.com/model/51439-pendix-edrive-dustcover) and a [holder for a plastic bag](https://www.printables.com/model/226822-bike-seat-plastic-bag-holder) which I can put on the seat when I leave the bike out in the rain.

## 😞 Battery Woes

Unfortunately, my joy was short-lived. The battery started failing just a couple of months in. A real bummer, considering I just bought it, but it was from 2018, so not really that shocking.

## 💰 Considering Alternatives

A new Pendix battery was ridiculously expensive, so I started to look at alternatives. Another buddy of mine recently converted his own bike with the Bafang BBS02 kit. This was approx. equally costly but should have more power.

## 🛠️ The Conversion Hiccup

The conversion was a challenge. My bike had an eccentric bottom bracket, making it incompatible with the Bafang motor. I had to make some, let's say, irreversible modifications, but the motor finally fit!

## 🎨 Aesthetic Touches to the Phone Mount

I also bought a Quad Lock copy for my phone, but its red color needed a spray-paint makeover.

## 😖 The Bafang Setback

Despite my best efforts, the Bafang motor proved too powerful for my bike's hub gear. The bike became jumpy and made weird noises—making for an unpleasant riding experience.

## 🔄 Back to Pendix

In the end, I reconnected with the local Pendix retailer. Luckily, he had a smaller Pendix battery that I could get for a reasonable 3000 kroners. 

![Pendix 150 vs 300](https://github.com/petrepa/petrepa.github.io/assets/30476405/3c93f464-a57a-40d4-bdf8-ecd5df41f57c)

So, I converted my bike back to Pendix, and here we are.




## 📝 Conclusion

Switching from a Boosted Board to a custom eBike has been a rollercoaster of a journey, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It's been an educational and fun experience. And has also led to another build ...
